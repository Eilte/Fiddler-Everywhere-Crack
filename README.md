## Fiddler-Everywhere-Crack
Amateur project, just for personal interest, long update cycle
## Help
#English
1. Install "Fiddler Everywhere 5.4.0.exe" and uncheck "Run Fiddler Everywhere" after installation and close the installer
2. Run disableUpdater.ps1 to block the update program. Windows 11 needs to run unsigned scripts in "Settings-System-Developer Options-PowerShell"
3. Right-click the "Fiddler Everywhere" shortcut on the desktop and "Open the location of the file". In the new file window, delete all files and folders except the "resources" folder
4. Copy all files and folders in the "Crack" folder to the installation directory of Fiddler Everywhere
5. Run Fiddler Everywhere, register and log in to the account to successfully crack. You can check whether the remaining trial time is 999999 days to verify
